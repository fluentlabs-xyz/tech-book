# Composability

Blended EEs within Fluent operating as execution proxies.
Since Fluent only supports rWasm bytecode, then every operation inside Fluent must be represented using rWasm ISA.

There are two main options for this approach:

1. **Translation**: A translation from one binary format into rWasm. This concept is used for Wasm application deployment where runtime is a Wasm â†’ rWasm compiler.

2. **Runtime**: An precompiled execution runtime developed using Wasm and compiled into machine code. This concept is used by EVM, SVM, ERC20 runtimes.

For example, Fluent presently incorporates the EVM/SVM using the account ownership method (aka runtime proxy).
A proxy with a delegate call forwards execution to a unique EVM/SVM loader smart contract.
This setup eliminates the need for address mapping or transaction verification.
ABI encoding/decoding format can be used, and contracts can be managed using default EVM/SVM-compatible data structures,
such as storage, block/transaction structures.

To achieve native composability on Fluent, an EE must coexist within the same trie space as the default EVM+Wasm EEs.
It should adhere to established EVM standards, including address formatting and derivation strategies
(for example, CREATE/CREATE2 for smart contract deployment).
The EE must not execute arbitrary account or state modifications 
and can only manage basic Ethereum-compatible accounts.

As a result, apps built with the proxy model can natively interoperate with other native-compatible EEs.
Since they share the same address space, isolation isn't required.
Consequently, Wasm apps can directly interact with EVM apps and vice versa.

## State Access

Fluent operates with state tries through a pure functional approach,
where every smart contract and root-STF can be represented as a function.
In this model, the input provides a list of dependencies,
and the output yields an execution result along with a number of logs.

However, this isn't entirely feasible due to cold storage reads and external storage dependencies,
such as CODEHASH-like EVM opcodes.
To address this, Fluent employs an interruption system to "request" missing information from the root-STF.
This is particularly useful for operations involving cold storage or invalidated warm storage.
