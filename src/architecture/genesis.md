# Genesis

The Genesis block, numbered 0, serves as the initial block in the blockchain. It defines fundamental blockchain
parameters, the genesis hash, and stores the initial blockchain state, including system contracts.

## Fluent Precompiled Contracts

Fluent provides the following genesis contracts:

- **EVM**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005210`
- **WASM**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005220`
- **SVM**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005230`

### EVM

EVM precompiled contract is responsible for managing EVM deployment and execution.
It embeds EVM virtual machine with ISA.

The contract defines two methods:

- `deploy` - for deploying EVM smart contract using EVM constructor (aka init code)
- `main` - for executing already deployed EVM contract

Keccak256 compatible code hash is stored inside special constant storage slot
calculated using function `keccak256("_evm_bytecode_hash")`.
The EVM bytecode is stored in the special preimage storage that uses CREATE2 for storing custom immutable data.

- EVM_BYTECODE_HASH_SLOT: `0xfd8a2cf66e0f80fe20ebc0e96c0e08e69c883c792a0409d4f4f92413fb66e980`

### WASM

> The contract is disabled for now, WASM support is achieved natively

### SVM

> TBD
