**AOT** (Ahead Of Time) — A type of compilation that converts high-level code to a lower-level code or machine code
before execution.

**JIT** (Just In Time) — A type of compilation that converts high-level code to intermediate or machine code at runtime,
typically to enhance performance during execution.
